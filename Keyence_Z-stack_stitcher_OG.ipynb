    "# Keyence Multipoint Stitcher\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a script for converting loose image files produced by the Keyence BZX800 into stitched z-stack image pyrimids.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script was written by Sam Budoff for the Poleg-Polsky lab's retina mapping project in February 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "This script makes use of the ImageJ stitching plugin which should be cited as: Preibisch, S., Saalfeld, S., & Tomancak, P. (2009). Globally optimal stitching of tiled 3D microscopic image acquisitions. Bioinformatics, 25(11), 1463–1465. doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp184\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, a limitation of this stitching plugin is it is very memory intensive, therefore it is necesary to use a PC with at least 10% more than twice the size of all image files in a multipoint subdirectory. For example, if your loose image tiles for a region of interest constitute 50 gb, you will need a computer with >110 gb RAM to run this stitching plugin. Additionally, the stitched image saving is very slow. That said, the script is set up to stitch each multipoint region of interest sequentially, so the memory considerations are related only to your largest region of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Script Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Load libraries and functions\n",
    "2) Define the root directory containing all multipoint aquistion subdirectories\n",
    "3) Create a dictionary containing paths to all loose image files\n",
    "4) Extract the metadata from teh respective multipoint aquisitions\n",
    "5) Create Z-stacks from each channel and each position\n",
    "6) Merge all channels from the z-stacks\n",
    "7) Compute the position of each tiles and store this as a FIJI Stitching Macro txt list\n",
    "8) Create a headless FIJI instance to run the stitcher\n",
    "9) Convert the stitched z-stacks into ome.tif pyrimids compatible with Xenium software\n",
    "10) Optional, delete intermediate files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paths and Hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Please adjust the path to your multipoint directory and any other hyperparameters here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the default images from Keyence have a 30% overlap and unless the color was specified as white for a channel the images are saved as RGB. I recommend saving the images as white as I have not validated the RGB to greyscale function behaves perfectly since this is an unusual choice on the developer's part for a flourescent microscope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster means aquisition followed an efficient \"snake\" pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAM_allowance specifies what percent of system RAM ImageJ can use for stitching. I find 97% to be safe with a computer that has 128 gb total, and would caution against setting much higher as this will cause a crash when it is particularly high. For exammple, I caused a crash to occur during testing when allowing 0.99% on a large stack test. If your image regions are too large and RAM is set appropriately, ImageJ will eventually stop on its own with a warning. If this happens it will be best to check how big your merged stacks directory is and ensure it is less than half the size of the RAM you allowed. If a computer with more RAM is unavailable, you will need to subset your original directory as needed being sure to duplicate the .gci archive file with metadata into each.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not need an image pyrimid or want to create one in a different software package, create_pyrimid can be set to false resulting in only the big tif output stored in the zstacks/Merged_stacks subdirectory. Note Image Pyrimid generation takes a very long time but for some applications is worth it. Note Pyrimids are generated with QuPath as this software's implementation is more than ten times faster than tifffile, even with GPU accelleration. Be sure to cite and follow the developer's instructions to install and make excecutable https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases/tag/v0.5.0 Bankhead, P. et al. QuPath: Open source software for digital pathology image analysis. Scientific Reports (2017).https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17204-5\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you can automatically delete all intermediate files generated in this script. To be clear this includes the single channel z-stacks at each tile location, the 4D tiles at each location, the IJ stitching coordinates, and the IJ Big Tif file. Only specify this if you are either happy to rerun the computation in the future and have a finite amound of storage on your computer as the IJ stitching alone can take 10s of minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "This code was validated by performing a large aquision on the keyence in which 18 multiD locations were aquired accounting for an area approximately 12x60 mm (2.5 xenium slides), with 4 color channels, and an appropriate number of z-slices to span each tissue region with a step size of 2 um and structured illumination ON. The aquisition consisted of 99090 out of the maximum possible 100000 indiviudal images. Aquisition took 71.77 hours (3 days). BZX required 0.99 TB for aquisition with final images occupying 0.52 TB, stored on an external drive connected via USB3. A second validation run was performed with 3 full xenium slides, accounting for roughlty a 12x72 mm^2 area with 24 regions. This aquisition was completed in about 40 hours, with all image processing in this notebook taking 9 hours (3 hours per section).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Image processing with this script was performed with a computer that has an Intel i7-12700KF CPU, NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU, and 128 GB of RAM, performing I/O on the aforementioned USB3 external drive. Image processing time took a total of 7hours; with 2 hours devoted to initial processing, 3 hours to stitching, and 3 hours to pyrimid conversion. Final pyramid files occupied a total of 112.3 GB."
